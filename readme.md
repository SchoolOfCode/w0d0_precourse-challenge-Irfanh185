# Why I have chosen my tribute page subject

Growing up following football [Manchester United](https://www.manutd.com/) was my team and Sir Alex was the manager who took a team that had not won any noted trophies for 25 years previously to become the **biggest football club in the world**.  I used to love his passion and conviction in getting the best out of his players.  During his term as manager being a Manchester United fan was great, you was always guaranteed a trophy every season, something I can't say for the last few years.  Thank you Sir Alex for giving me some great memories growing up!
